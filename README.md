# Detect-the-Only-Duplicate-in-a-List
>20th May 2021

The only way to track my coding progress is to add these practice questions in these repositories. So I've come across this question and I'm trying to solve it.

***You are given a list nums of length n + 1 picked from the range 1, 2, ..., n. By the pigeonhole principle, there must be a duplicate. Find and return it. There is guaranteed to be exactly one duplicate.***

***Bonus: Can you do this in \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) time and \mathcal{O}(1)O(1) space?***

I'm not too sure about the bonus part yet but the idea behind my current code is to loop through the list comparing the values at each indexes to each other and comparing them. If they're the same it returns the "duplicate".

Now this is a simple newbie approach and so runs into the ***"Time Limit Exceeded"*** problem.
When I've fixed it I'll be updating this with what I improved on the code.
